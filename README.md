Goals
====

1. Use motion sensor data captured by a smartphone to classify the quality of a
  video.

2. Implement the data exchange between a server and several smartphones. The
  smartphones compute the video quality from sensor information and send it to
  the server. The server makes a decision about suitable video streams and sends
  notifications to the clients. Notified clients upload their videos to the server.

3. Write a 10 page report (IEEE style)
  which discusses the implemented application.
